i deserved more,

i deserved more, 

i deserved more,

i feel like i've always deserved more, 

when someone's unclear, i've always felt that i deserved more, rather than to try and decode and understand

when someone's unsure, i've always felt that i deserved more, rather than to try to ask, "why?"

if i was important, wouldn't you be more clearer? 

wouldn't you be more sure? 

i don't know.

this is wild to be honest, 

i've asked the whale sharks,

the island, 

the sands &

the creatures of Cebu, 

i've always felt that i deserved more, 

i don't know, it's confusing me to the core,

i've been doing good, 

so i guess

it's best that i deal not with this, 

and keep it in a box,

lock it up, 

and throw the keys to the deepest seas of this world.

maybe i'll deal with this when i'm older,

old enough to not remember.

all i know is, 

i deserved more,

i rescued everyone, 

and no one was there to rescue me, 

it was only me and me alone.

sorry, i don't have time anymore.

i wasted them trying to understand everything.

xx,
master
