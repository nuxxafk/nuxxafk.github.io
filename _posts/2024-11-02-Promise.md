Don't make promises you can't fulfill, they said. 
What a load of hooey. If you still believe in promises, 
You're in make believe land. 
The world is not fair and will never be. So I did not became fair once I
Found out that you were not fair. 
All the promises are based on the premise that we are both fair. 
Once the fairness goes, so are the promises.
I have no regrets in breaking my promises. 
Because I was always fair most of the time.
