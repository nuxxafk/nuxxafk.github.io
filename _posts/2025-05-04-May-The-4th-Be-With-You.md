It's been 5 months since I last entered something here. 

Much has happened ever since, everyone seems to be in a better place now (I am too) and I would not trade what I have now for anything. 

I love that I always have time to learn and have the chance to not repeat the same mistakes that I did before. To not cave in to something, just because I did not know how to set boundaries. 

It's weird that before this year, "family" for me is just an organization you have to prioritize and maintain. 

But seeing that I seem to be loving family time now, so much so that I maybe starting my own soon, everything changes.

You know when it's 3am, it's quiet, I sometimes wish Dad was here or I just wished I had this thing back then. 

Instead of treating it of what I had treated it as before. Because I've been a stubborn idiot back then. 

Always thinking that "we'll always have next time & there's always time", then being proved wrong, with time running out afterwards. 

You know I'll always thank everyone i have met in my life, but our time here is limited. 

I'd rather spend my time with my family instead of other people to be honest. 

And i'd rather spend time on things that will improve my family's QOL instead of satisfying other people. 


So I guess you'll never see me again. Which is the better choice for all of us. 
You'll never see me in the same place I ever was, like I've said before. 

Best, master
