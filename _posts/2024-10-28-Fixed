title: Upload fixed
---

Upload is fixed now.. had to reconfigure some things with our server. 
I might have to remove that as a step in the future.. shits making things complicated. 
I'm not entirely sure if ya'll commits will go through.. i don't have a hold of your .md files.. won't be able to reupload your shit. 
Anyway, I've enabled our internal blog and created a janky ass solution that somehow connects it to our external blog.. 
I don't know if it'll work though... if it doesn't then just use this url whatever you want as long as we don't get dmca.
Also we're having raid issues on our secondary linux server.. i've raised this concern to the service provider, 
so ya'll run your computations / big data compilations on the primary for now.
It'll bog down, but atleast you can finish your projects. 

Cache rebuild will take around a couple of hours..
I have a test blog post after this. (doesn't mean that the new function will work if it'll get uploaded)
