Happy New Year! 
I guess congratulations are in order since you made it.

For some, this maybe a typical new year. 
And have their new year's resolution shared in passing without even thinking of it.

For us, for me, this is different. 

Time flies fast and we're essentially in a big hour glass. 
I do regret wasting time and resources last year that I could've focused on myself and my family. 
But what's wonderful about this world is it gives you time to learn. 

Luckily, I learn. 

This year is for personal and relationship growth. 
Mix in some professional growth in there. 
Old habits die hard but they die eventually. 

I said bye to non-essential things, non-essential people. <br/>
This is a year to stay & lay low, so I can be propelled to greater heights. 

You'll never see me again, 
L
