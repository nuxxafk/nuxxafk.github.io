title:  "What the Hell"
---

you know,
i've always wanted the best for my people,
i loved everyone and everything,

i wanted to make a difference,
when i was in my slump back in college,
every little interaction made a difference,
i started to crawl back into life,
and this is what inspired me.

i've always been an available person, 
a person you can go through,
a person you can always talk to;
because i've always wanted to help everybody,
again, to make a difference
that when no one believes in you,
i do,
and when no one wants to listen to your screams, 
i do. 

but to be honest, 
i kind of lost myself during the process, 
i didn't realize that i've lost myself once i started losing someone i truly love;
i was holding on so long that it felt like i'm holding a knife's blade while freefalling, 
it was painful, i guess
i've felt it before, 
but i've already forgotten how to deal it,

so what I did was I think was right for me at that time,
it might be wrong for you, but it was only the only choice i had,

i had to lay low and cut everyone off,
for my sake, for their sake, for my peace, 
even the closest ones, who i've felt were family already, 

ever since 2021, i've been slowly crumbling, 
and to make me feel good, i tried to help everyone as I could, 
just like Dad used to do,
but you just can't help everyone,
and there's no difference if they don't see it. 

it's just so hard to be whole again,
i had a chance in 2023 but i don't know what the fuck happened there so.. 
there's that. 

so here am I, composing this thing, in a place overlooking the bay area,
it's nice I guess, but it's been a very busy 2025. 
i almost feel as if I have no chance to breath for relaxation, (but it's cebu, maybe i can breathe a little bit?)
i've been so busy i can no longer remember what happened last week lol
so yeah, i'm pretty much unavailable now. 

it's impossible to get time from me now,
i can't even free up my schedule for myself, lol 

anyway,
here ends whatever this is, 
i don't even know why i still use this blog,
knowing that this is not even active anymore, 
but i call a spade a spade.

this helps and this makes a difference.

thanks,
master
