We never unlove people; 
We leave a part of ourselves with them that loves them. 
Then, we move on, 
Like the earth never stays in the same coordinates within the universe. 
We can never go back, 

But we take comfort in the fact that we loved, felt alive, and grew from the experience.

Sometimes, we might still feel the urge to reach out, 

But moving forward means trusting our decisions and embracing the path ahead. 

So I'll see you, if I see you again, 


stranger.
