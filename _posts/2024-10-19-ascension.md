Programming / scripting is such an art. 
I hate how much I missed doing this shit, frankly I'm enjoying it much more now. 
While I do have a somewhat good grasp of these things, I just learn new things everyday. 
I doubted and pretty much killed myself for the past 3 years. Grief is such a hard thing. 
I forgot what I can do and my capabilities were. 

So I reiterate once again. 
Stop stopping. 
For anyone, may it be love or grief or anything. 

We may have done this mistake a couple of times last year. 
But we're not stopping now. 

The hype train is full speed ahead!
