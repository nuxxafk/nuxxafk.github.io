This is a recreation of an internal blogging feature we had before (that some members turned into a vent-out feature, while I don't really know why they can't have their own tumblrs / blogs, i understand them now). I had to refork the repo recently due to some gremlins I'm encountering that I was too lazy to solve. So here we are. 
I own the domain and created the index of the main url. This was put together by the team, I just linked it to the main url (fil insisted.. i don't know what the fuck his agenda is lol)
